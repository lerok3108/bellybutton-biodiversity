# bellybutton-biodiversity
## About the Project
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive dashboard that displayed information about bacteria inside the human's belly button. Raw data was provided as a sample of hundreds of people. This interactive dashboard allows users to select the participant's ID and review their demographic information, top 10 bacteria found, frequency of belly button washing per week, and the bacteria cultures per sample.
